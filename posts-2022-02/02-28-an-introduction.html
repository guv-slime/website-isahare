            <p>The name's Emory Hare, and my username? Well…it's just my first name plus “is a” followed by my last name. I'm literally a Hare. It's not that great of a username, but I've used it forever, and it kinda suits me. Anyway, let's move past my name / username and get into the nitty gritty of what this blog is all about…me.

            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">emory.About()</h2>
            <p>
                I am a 26 y/o artist man. I have struggled with my physical and mental health for much of my adult life, and I want to share some of my experiences here because for the first time in many years, I feel like things are getting better for me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My anxiety and depression have been with me since childhood but really ramped up during my college years. My inability to hold down a 9 to 5 job after graduating has persisted for years, but thankfully, I can say that I have found the work-life balance that works for me. I am able to get things done by a certain date, but I'm not always able to start and end at the same time each day. I've realized how important that flexibility is for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an aspiring artist, and I have been drawing since I was a young child. Apparently, I drew a three-dimensional cup at 3 years old and blew my family's minds.
            </p>
            <p>
                At age 5, I was gaming on a purple gameboy color and PC (Windows 98 FTW). Gaming has shaped my way of thinking, my taste in art, and my love of puzzles. In a way, it is what pushed me to major in computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
                After college, I bounced from different jobs, but I've recently decided to start my own freelancing / design business. Digital art is one of the three pillars of my freelance design business. The other pillars are graphic design and web design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also live stream on Twitch, which is now part of my daily work life. I am able to show my work to the world as I make it.
            </p>
            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">this.Blog()</h2>
            <p>
                This blog will be about anything that I find interesting or worth sharing. There are many things, but I will list the gist of what I plan to write about:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Digital Art (software, tools, my workflow, my growth as an artist, individual pieces)
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Live-streaming (art, development, gaming)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Programming / Web Development (my journey, helpful tips for other beginners, software, explanations that are easy to understand, the best resources for help)
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Reviews for various things that I find useful or interesting</p>
                        <li class="blog-list-sub-item">
                            <p>Software</p>

                        <li class="blog-list-sub-item">
                            <p>Apps</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="blog-list-sub-item">
                            <p>Tools</p>

                        <li class="blog-list-sub-item">

                        <li class="blog-list-sub-item">
                            <p>Books</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="blog-list-sub-item">
                            <p>Gizmos & Gadgets</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                   <p>Original comics or Clog Posts </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I plan to post weekly to start. The posts may end up more like journal entries if I motivate myself to do it everyday. I would like to have thoughtful posts or helpful guides once a week though. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I livestream Monday through Friday and post to instagram about once a week. I tweet pretty regularly, so Twitter is probably the best place to go if you want to know when a new blog post is available.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am blogging to develop my voice as a writer. I want to see if what I put down on paper is how I feel. I also want to help people who are in a similar situation or want to create things. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">this.Conclusion()</h2>
            <p>
                So that pretty much wraps up the first post. Was it good? Was it interesting? I don't know how to add a commenting section to this blog, so tweet at me and let me know if I do GOOD.
            </p>
            <p>
                This post will be buried at the bottom of my iframe on my blog page eventually, but it's the start of something new. An all HTML/CSS blog is all I can make right now, but we will see how far I can take it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for reading! 
            </p>
